<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Currently, I am a 17 year old highschool student with a big dream for making games as a career. I am trying to learn a couple of programming languages like C#, Ruby, HTML, Java, C++, and Python. Some of these languages like C#, C++, and Java is used to make games which is what I want to do. But other languages like Ruby, HTML, and Python is for web development which is a some side knowledge I would like to know. Ruby is what I used to program this website you see before you.  </p>
